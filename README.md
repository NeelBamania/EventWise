# EventWise â€“ Smart Event Management Platform

EventWise is a microservices-based event management system that allows users to register, track, and receive updates for various events (webinars, workshops, conferences). Organizers can manage events and monitor user engagement with real-time notifications and analytics.

## Project Features
- User registration, authentication, and profiles
- Event creation and discovery
- Event registration and waitlisting
- Email/SMS notifications
- Optional analytics dashboard
- Dockerized services and Kubernetes deployment
- CI/CD integration and observability with Prometheus/Grafana
